Installed MediaWiki on Windows using following steps:

1. Downloaded MediaWiki 1.31.1 archive and XAMPP
2. Installed XAMPP and configured and started Apache and MySQL server
3. Extracted the MediaWiki archive in htdocs folder (present in xampp installation files' folder) 
   and kept the whole data of the archive in mediawiki folder created in htdocs folder.
4. Then initially while accessing mediawiki we got the setup page where we needed to set it up. 
   Then they prompted to download a file named LocalSettings.php and move it into the mediawiki 
   folder (present in htdocs folder in xampp folder).
5. MediaWiki was accessible by using the link http://localhost/mediawiki and it was opening the Main wiki page.
